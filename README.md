## # A collection of Data Science projects just for fun

Here I am making a collection of different Data Science Projects.
The final idea is that you find what you are looking for.
Will start with a kmean basic clustering and then we will see what else I can add.

## Clustering
I add a KMean clustering model made with scikit-learn... It clusters customers.

## Keras (MSE)
I added a model using keras that predicts car prices based on the car features and the company that made it

## Decision Trees
I added a model that predicts the quality of a wine based on features such as citric acid and residual sugar

## Binary Classification
In process
