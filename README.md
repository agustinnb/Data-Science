## # A collection of Data Science projects just for fun

Here I am making a collection of different Data Science Projects.
The final idea is that you find what you are looking for.
Will start with a kmean basic clustering and then we will see what else I can add.

## Clustering
#### Scikit-Learn
KMean clustering models: 
** Customers Clustering
** Business School Clustering
** IMDB Best 1000 movies Clustering

#### PySpark
Added a model that clusters Spotify Tracks and recommend artists


## Decision Trees
#### Scikit-Learn
##### Qualification
** Added a model that predicts the quality of a wine based on features such as citric acid and residual sugar
##### Forecasting
** Added a model that predicts next price variation of XAU-USD (By Day)
** Added Mumbai Rain Forecasting model
** Added model that predict California Crime for the next year 

## Linear Regression
#### PySpark
** Added a model that predicts data scientist salaries
#### Scikit-Learn
** Added a model that predicts california house prices

## Binary Classification
#### Scikit-Learn
** Added a simple model to try to predict and classify smokers and non-smokers
#### PySpark
** Added model that predicts heart disease

## NLP
#### Tensorflow-keras
** Added a model that classify products between four categories by their description
** Added model that catalog mails between spam and ham
** Added a model that try to guess a movie review rate based on the review text of it.
** Added model that predicts Airline's review rates and recommendation

## RNNs
#### Tensorflow-keras
##### Binary Classification
** Added model that predict diabetes condition
##### Image Recognition
** Added a model that recognize ducks
** Added a model that recognize Types of haircuts
##### MSE
** Added a model using keras that predicts Car Prices based on the car features and the company that made it
** Added a model using keras that predicts the Food Order Total Cost by day of the week and hour ordered.
