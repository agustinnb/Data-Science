## # A collection of Data Science projects just for fun

Here I am making a collection of different Data Science Projects.
The final idea is that you find what you are looking for.
Will start with a kmean basic clustering and then we will see what else I can add.

## Clustering
#### Scikit-Learn
I add a KMean clustering model made with scikit-learn... It clusters customers.

## Decision Trees
#### Scikit-Learn
I added a model that predicts the quality of a wine based on features such as citric acid and residual sugar

## Linear Regression
#### PySpark
Added a model that predicts data scientist salaries
#### Scikit-Learn
Added a model that predicts california house prices

## Binary Classification
#### Scikit-Learn
Added a simple model to try to predict and classify smokers and non-smokers
#### PySpark
Added model that predicts heart disease

## NLP
#### Tensorflow-keras
Added a model that classify products between four categories by their description

## RNNs
#### Tensorflow-keras
##### Image Recognition
Added a model that recognize ducks
##### MSE
I added a model using keras that predicts car prices based on the car features and the company that made it
